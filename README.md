# CrazyTattooGallery

This is a <b>MERN (MongoDB - Express - React - Node) JS web app</b> to find out about the latest trends in tattoos in order to find the right artist for you: https://crazytattoogallery.herokuapp.com/
The project has been built for the startup FindMyTattoo and was aimed to be a first MVP. All of its features have been validated by tattoo artists. The MVP is aimed at finding out the commercial interest of such business for users who want to get tattooed.

The main features of the app :
<ul>
  <li>View a catalogue of tattoos displayed in the Instagram style</li>
  <li>Find out more about the tattoo and the artist who made it by clicking on the tattoo</li>
  <li>Login access with crypted password to start liking tattoos or artists in order to remember them for your next visit</li>
  <li>View the gallery of all your favorite tattoos and artists</li>
  <li>Contact the artist by filling in a simple form which will send an email directly to the artist with your contact details in order for the artist to call you back</li>
</ul>

The app was built by a team of three Junior developpers : Wassima, Madian and Fran√ßois. While working for the app, we learnt about :
<ol>
  <li>Setting up a back-end server on <b>node.JS using Express framework</b></li>
  <li>Scraping data from a competitor using <b>cheerio library</b> in order to enrich our tattoo and artist database</li>
  <li>Setting up, reading and updating a <b>mongo DB with Mongoose Framework</b> to keep in memory the tattoos, the artists, the users and the leads between users and artists (NoSQL and SQL style database)</li>
  <li>Building a multi-component <b>React</b> web app with a <b>Redux</b> architecture to store locally data on the user</li>
  <li>Connecing the React app to the back-end server</li>
</ol>
